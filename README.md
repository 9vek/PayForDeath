# PayForDeath
 a minecraft spigot plugin add death penalty feature to the server



**[ INTRODUCTION ]**

Many death penalty plugins are either too heavy or outdated, and Kevyn's PayForDeath is a lightweight death penalty plugin base on Vault's money system.

The function is very simple: Players must have enough money to avoid dropping levels and items on death. It supports different configurations in different world and can be completely customized.

This provides an elegant way to increase the cost of death, at the same time, it can enrich the economic system of your server, so that the player's money can be used for one more purpose.
